Throughout this article, the terms **server**/**server-side** and **client**/**client-side** are used to distinguish locations where app code executes:

* **Server**/**server-side**: Interactive Server rendering in a Blazor Web App. The `Program` file is `Program.cs` of the server project. Blazor script start configuration is found in the `App` component (`Components/App.razor`). Only routable Server render mode components with an `@page` directive are placed in the `Components/Pages` folder. Non-routable shared components are placed in the server project's `Components` folder. Create custom folders based on component functionality as needed.
* **Client**/**client-side**
  * Interactive WebAssembly rendering in a Blazor Web App. The `Program` file is `Program.cs` of the client project (`.Client`). Blazor script start configuration is found in the `App` component (`Components/App.razor`) of the server project. Routable Interactive WebAssembly and Interactive Auto components with an `@page` directive are placed in the client project's `Pages` folder. Place non-routable shared components at the root of the `.Client` project or in custom folders based on component functionality.
  * A Blazor WebAssembly app. The `Program` file is `Program.cs`. Blazor script start configuration is found in the `wwwroot/index.html` file.
